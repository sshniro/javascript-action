          <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that
          helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross
          Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are
          used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution
          of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow
          website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers
          should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript,
          CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java
          applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</p>

          Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect
          the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of
          a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never
          expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows

          browsers).</p>
